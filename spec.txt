1.  Introduction

   In OAuth, an authorization server issues access tokens to clients,
   which are used to access protected resources hosted by a resource
   server.  Prior to issuing tokens, the authorization server
   authenticates the end-user and obtains consent.  This interaction
   establishes a session in which the end-user accesses both the
   authorization server and one or more applications.

   These sessions can be long-lived, lasting for days or months.  During
   this time, the status of the end-user and her device, such as
   location, network address, or security posture, may change - requring
   a change in access privileges.  Unfortunately, typical OAuth
   deployments determine access only at the time of authentication and
   lack awareness of dynamically changing information about ongoing
   sessions.

   This specification defines a mechanism in which clients and resource
   servers can share session signals with an authorization server.
   These signals are transported using existing OAuth 2.0 endpoints.
   Use of existing endpoints is intended to provide a lightweight
   approach to continuous authorization, while complimenting future
   protocols that provide real-time access evaluation using a publish-
   subscribe approach.

1.1.  Client Profiles

   This specification has been designed around the client profiles
   defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC6749]:

   web application:  A web application is a confidential client running
      on a web server.  Resource owners access the client via an HTML
      user interface rendered in a user-agent on the device used by the
      resource owner.  The client credentials as well as any access
      token issued to the client are stored on the web server and are
      not exposed to or accessible by the resource owner.

   user-agent-based application:  A user-agent-based application is a
      public client in which the client code is downloaded from a web
      server and executes within a user-agent (e.g., web browser) on the
      device used by the resource owner.  Protocol data and credentials
      are easily accessible (and often visible) to the resource owner.
      Since such applications reside within the user-agent, they can
      make seamless use of the user-agent capabilities when requesting
      authorization.

   native application:  A native application is a public client
      installed and executed on the device used by the resource owner.

      Protocol data and credentials are accessible to the resource
      owner.  It is assumed that any client authentication credentials
      included in the application can be extracted.  On the other hand,
      dynamically issued credentials such as access tokens or refresh
      tokens can receive an acceptable level of protection.  At a
      minimum, these credentials are protected from hostile servers with
      which the application may interact.  On some platforms, these
      credentials might be protected from other applications residing on
      the same device.

1.2.  Token Locality

   After obtaining approval of the end-user via interaction within the
   end-user's user-agent, OAuth issues delegation-specific access tokens
   and refresh tokens to clients.  This specification defines two token
   localities, based on where tokens reside relative to the user-agent
   in which the issuance was approved:

   off device:  A token is off device when it resides with an
      application that is not located on the same device as the end-
      user's user-agent.  Tokens issued to a web application are off
      device, as the application runs on a web server acceessed remotely
      via the user-agent.

   on device:  A token is on device when it resides with an application
      that is located on the same device as the end-user's user-agent.
      Tokens issued to native native applications and user-agent-based
      applications are on device, as the application is executing either
      on the device or within the user-agent itself.

2.  Signal Sharing

2.1.  Refreshing an Access Token

2.1.1.  From On Device

   A native application possessing a refresh token that is on device
   shares signals by making a refresh request that includes device
   posture, as defined in section 6 of
   [I-D.wdenniss-oauth-device-posture].

   For example, the client makes the following HTTP request using
   transport-layer security (with extra line breaks for display purposes
   only):

Internet-Draft                    scss                      October 2019


   POST /token HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA
   client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&device_posture=%7B%22screen_lock%22%3Atrue%2C
   %22device_os%22%3A%22iOS%22%2C%22device_os_version%22%3A%2211.1%22%7D

2.1.2.  From Off Device

   A web application posessing a refresh token that is off device shares
   signals by making a refresh request that includes user-agent posture,
   as defined by User Agent Posture Signals.

   For example, the client makes the following HTTP request using
   transport-layer security (with extra line breaks for display purposes
   only):

  POST /token HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.example.com
  Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

  grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA
  client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&user_agent_posture=%7B%22user_agent%22%3A%22Mozilla%2F5.0
  %20%28Macintosh%3B%20Intel%20Mac%20OS%20X%2010_14_5%29%20AppleWebKit%2F537.36
  %20%28KHTML%2C%20like%20Gecko%29%20Chrome%2F75.0.3770.142%20Safari%2F537.36%22
  %2C%22ip_address%22%3A%2293.184.216.34%22%7D

   The client MUST only include user-agent posture in online access
   scenarios.  Refresh tokens used in offline scenarios, when the end-
   user is not present, are decoupled from the session and lack end-user
   user agent context.

2.2.  Token Introspection

2.2.1.  Introspection Request

   A resource server querying for to determine the state of an access
   token shares signals by making an by making an introspection request
   to the introspection endpoint, as defined in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC7662].

   In addition to the parameters defined by Section 2.1 of [RFC7662],
   the following parameters are also defined:

Internet-Draft                    scss                      October 2019


   user_agent_posture  OPTIONAL.  URL-encoded JSON dictionary,
      containing user-agent posture signals, as defined by User Agent
      Posture Signals.

   For example, the client makes the following HTTP request using
   transport-layer security (with extra line breaks for display purposes
   only):

  POST /introspect HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.example.com
  Accept: application/json
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW

  token=mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM&token_type_hint=access_token
  &user_agent_posture=%7B%22user_agent%22%3A%22Mozilla%2F5.0
  %20%28Macintosh%3B%20Intel%20Mac%20OS%20X%2010_14_5%29%20AppleWebKit%2F537.36
  %20%28KHTML%2C%20like%20Gecko%29%20Chrome%2F75.0.3770.142%20Safari%2F537.36%22
  %2C%22ip_address%22%3A%2293.184.216.34%22%7D

   Note that the locality of an access token is always off device when
   presented to a resource server.
